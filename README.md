# jkutils

A Python package with various utility functions that I use regularly.

Developed for Python3.3 and tested on Python2.7. Other versions my work
but I do not make any guarantees.

## Installation

Use pip to fix any requirements more or less automatically:

    pip install -e .

If you have met the requirements you can also do the more traditional:

    python setup.py install

See _requirements.txt_ to sort out dependencies using your normal package
manager.
